# FTMK Workshop Submission

## Project Overview
  Workshop 1 (Project 1) is an important subject which the student has to take in order to graduate from the university.  The Workshop subject at UTeM is comprised of Workshop 1 and Workshop 2. Students must pass the Workshop 1 in order to take the Workshop 2. Students who are taking the project have to build a system or application that is related to Information Technology (IT) at the end of the semester to pass. 

  The people who are involved in processes are Workshop committee, supervisors and Faculty General Office (FGO). The working processes of Workshop 1 are very tedious and required a lot of manual works. These processes include the “Project Title Proposal Compilation”, “Supervisor Assignment”, “Moderator Assignment”, and “Reports Generation”. The management of these processes needs a lot of manpower and all of them are time consuming. Therefore, a proper management in the work flows is very important. 

  In order to manage and reduce the work processes, UTeM FTMK Workshop 1: Submission & Auto Reporting System has to be developed to hasten the work processes of the project. The main purpose is to reduce paper work and improve the speeding up all the processes. Information about workshop project and files uploaded are available to lecturer and student. Furthermore, the objective is to build a good management tool, reduce time taken through manual system in order to maintain all the records, easily track information of student, lecturer, and workshop 1. Moreover, the scope of the project is to reduce the time and complexity of maintaining the record. System target user is designed for Educational Institute which deal with lecturer and student.
